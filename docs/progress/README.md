# Progress Tracking Guide

## Purpose
Track implementation progress across multiple sessions and maintain continuity for the Bridge The Game project.

## Structure
```
progress/
├── plan2/          # Current: Backfill trigger implementation
│   ├── CHECKLIST.md   # Task checklist with completion status
│   ├── TESTS.md       # Test results and sample data
│   └── DECISIONS.md   # Implementation choices and rationale
└── plan3/          # Future: Next API integration
    └── ...
```

## How to Use

### Starting a Session
Tell Claude: "Continue Plan 2 implementation, check docs/progress/plan2/CHECKLIST.md"

### During Development
1. Check off completed items in CHECKLIST.md
2. Log test results in TESTS.md
3. Document any decisions or discoveries in DECISIONS.md

### Ending a Session
1. Update CHECKLIST.md with current status
2. Note any blockers or next steps
3. Update "Last Updated" date

## Quick Status Check
Look at `CHECKLIST.md` for:
- ✅ Completed tasks
- 🚧 In-progress work
- 📦 Upcoming tasks
- 📝 Important notes

## Best Practices
- Update progress in real-time, not at the end
- Include error messages and stack traces in TESTS.md
- Document "why" in DECISIONS.md, not just "what"
- Keep sample responses for future reference
